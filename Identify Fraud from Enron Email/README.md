# Identify Fraud from Enron Email
This project uses machine learning to identify fraud from the Enron corpus. Much of the preprocessing code was provided by the Udacity data analyst Nanodegree.

Key files in the final project are the Documentation of Enron Classification and poi_id.py.

poi_id.py is the major output of the project, where automatic feature selection and model tuning are used to create better algorithms.
