# Explore and Summarize Data

In this project I used R and ggplot to explore a dataset of red wine. All necessary files are included in the repo, including the data file (wineQualityReds.csv) and data documentation (wineQualityInfo.txt).

The analysis is best viewed in the knitted html file, but R code for the plots and other analysis can be found in the .rmd file.
